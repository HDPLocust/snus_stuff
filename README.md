* [snus_string](snus_string.md) provides some basic string stuff, include utf8 (utf8 regex not supported because database of utf8 class characters is pretty BIG).
* [snus_table](snus_table.md) gives access to such important (no) functions like `map`, wery optimized `filter` and some iterators. 
* [snus_md](snus_md.md) it's just simplest doc extractor from code files. On Windows you can just drag-and-drop file with `--[[!MD ... ]]` comments to it and get .md file near source file.
